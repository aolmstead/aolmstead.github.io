				<h3 style="color: #303030">I'm a keyboardist in Chicago with a background in improvised music.</h3>
				
				<p>Formerly an an active part of the Seattle music scene, I helped present a <a href="http://www.racersessions.com/about">weekly music series</a> and worked with a local record label, <a href="http://www.racersessions.com/tc-discography">Table&amp;Chairs Music</a>. In addition to writing and performing in my own solo project, I played regularly as a sideman in <a href="projects.html">several other bands</a>. I moved to Chicago at the beginning of 2019 in search of even more music and creativity. A new year, a new city, and new people to share music with!</p>
				
				<p>I also enjoy <a href="lessons.html">teaching piano students</a> of all skill levels to perform, improvise, collaborate with others, and write their own music. To ask about taking piano lessons, playing a show with one of my projects, or otherwise interacting with me, email

				<p>I also have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and program things part-time, but I don't have a page for that. I guess you'll just have to trust me. Alternatively, come to
